<p>Alarmél Valli's work has been featured at landmark theatres and festivals in India and abroad.  In 1986, Valli founded the Dipasikha Dance Foundation and Educational Trust. Through lecture demonstrations, master classes, workshops and seminars in India and abroad, Valli shares her thoughts on Bharatanatyam, as a dynamic, contemporary dance language. Poetry and musicality of movement are core elements in Alarmél Valli's approach to dance. Her early training in music under the renowned musician, T. Muktha, helped shape her ideal of an intensely musical dance style and honed her approach to dance, as a harmonious extension of verbal melody. Alarmél Valli's understanding of dance was also enriched by her study of Odissi, under eminent Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra and his disciple, Guru Ramani Ranjan Jena. Her extensive research on Sangam poems, for over two decades, has resulted in a significant repertoire of dance poems. In her interpretation and choreography of poetry, Alarmél Valli explores subtexts and works with musicians to give the texts a visual and melodic dimension.<br>
