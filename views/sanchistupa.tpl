Sanchi Stupa stands inside an ancient Buddhist complex in Madhya Pradesh, situated on top of a hill in a small town called Sanchi. The complex is best known for the Great Stupa, one of the oldest stone Buddhist monuments in India. With over 2,000 years of history, it remains a living example of the art and architecture that flourished during the rule of Emperor Ashoka. </font><br>

The Great Stupa at Sanchi exhibits the Buddhist architectural style. With a height of 54 feet and a pedestal diameter of 120 feet, it is one of the largest of its kind in the whole country. The main structure of the Stupa is a hemispherical dome that has a simple design. The dome rests on a base, under which is a relic chamber. According to popular beliefs, the dome was constructed over the relics belonging to Lord Buddha. That is why it was adorned with three chhatris (umbrella-like structures) meant to shelter the relics. The three structures are said to stand for Triantha or the three jewels of Buddhism, namely the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. A large central pillar supports the chhatris.
The railings surrounding the Great Stupa are devoid of any artistic décor. These railings are nothing more than plain slabs bearing dedicatory inscriptions. There are four intricately ornamented ceremonial gateways that face all four directions. Scenes from Jataka stories, events of Buddha’s life, scenes from early Buddhism period, and several auspicious symbols are carved on these ceremonial gateways.<br>
