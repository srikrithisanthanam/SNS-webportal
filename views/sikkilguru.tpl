<hr color="maroon" size=5><font size=4 align="justify">
<p>Sikkil C. Gurucharan is among the foremost young performing musicians of Carnatic music in India today. He is the grandson of Sikkil Kunjumani, elder of the internationally acclaimed flautists the Sikkil Sisters. He is an 'A' grade All India Radio artist. Showing immense promise at the age of five, Gurucharan was coaxed by his grandmothers to pursue Carnatic Music further. Although his family is well-known for their affiliation to flute, his vocal expertise was commendable at that age itself with perfect alignment of notes.<br><br><p>
Apart from performing the traditional Carnatic music concerts conforming to the Paddathi style, Sikkil Gurucharan and pianist Anil Srinivasan, have brought together the classical piano and Carnatic vocal music to create a format which has been termed as "devastatingly beautiful" by the legendary guitarist, John McLaughlin. Their music which has gathered followers in India, Singapore, Australia, USA and Europe in a short span of time, presents and preserves classical music in a way that reaches out to the younger listeners of music but at the same time, satisfies the puritans who look out for the aesthetic value. They have several albums to their credit.<br>
