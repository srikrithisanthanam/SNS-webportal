<p>Sriranjani Santhanagopalan (Born 14th March, 1989) is one of the most sought after musicians in the Carnatic music field today. She is the daughter and disciple of Vidwan Neyveli.Sri.R.Santhanagopalan. She has a consistent record of well-received concerts, and has traveled extensively within India and abroad including almost 25 cities in the United States of America, Singapore, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, Australia, New Zealand etc, propagating the divine art of Carnatic music. Sriranjani also runs a highly successful music school namely, “Sriranjani’s Tapasya”
<br>
<p>Successful musicians in the past were generally not in favour of their wards taking up music as their profession. The reasons were the hardships they had faced in their career and also the uncharitable comparisons that people often made between them and their offsprings. Till about three decades ago, concert opportunities were quite limited, which discouraged youngsters from taking up music as their career. Of course, the constant ‘sound of music’ at home did rub off on the children and they became quite knowledgeable, though they did not necessarily become performers.
Things have changed to some extent now. With the increase in performing opportunities, growing independence and self-confidence of the younger generation, and the rigours of the profession getting mitigated considerably, we do have youngsters from music families taking up careers in music.
<p>One such young musician is 22-year old vocalist Sriranjani, daughter of the popular musician Neyveli Santhanagopalan. Santhanagopalan, the most important disciple of Madurai T.N. Seshagopalan, has over the years, evolved a style of his own, emphasising bhava with influence drawn from such musicians as Tanjavur Sankara Iyer. Sriranjani’s earliest inspiration was undoubtedly her father, but while growing up, she was deeply attracted to the music of the late Madurai Mani, Semmangudi and Ramnad Krishnan whose recordings are now freely available with collectors and on the Internet.
